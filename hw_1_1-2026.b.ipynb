    "\n",
    "How to Change Cell Types\n",
    "You can toggle a cell from Markdown to Code using two main methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "Keyboard Shortcut: 1. Click outside the text area of the cell (or press Esc) to enter Command Mode. 2. Press Y to change it to a Code cell. 3. (Conversely, press M to change it back to Markdown).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Toolbar: 1. Click the dropdown menu at the top of the notebook interface (which usually says \"Markdown\" or \"Code\"). 2. Select Code from the list.\n",

    "==\tEquality Operator\tUsed to compare two values. It asks the computer, \"Are these two things equal?\" and returns True or False.\n",
    "Code Examples\n",
    "1. The Assignment Operator (=)\n",
    "Think of this as putting a label on a box.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python\n",
    "# We are assigning the value 10 to the variable 'x'\n",
    "x = 10\n",
    "\n",
    "print(x)  # Output: 10\n",
    "2. The Equality Operator (==)\n",

    "\n",
    "Python\n",
    "# This is a full-line comment\n",
    "x = 5  # This is an \"inline\" comment explaining the variable\n",
    "2. Multi-Line Comments (Docstrings)\n",
    "Python doesn't have a specific \"multi-line\" comment symbol, but programmers use triple quotes (''' or \"\"\") to achieve this. While technically these create multi-line strings, if they aren't assigned to a variable, Python simply skips over them.\n",

    "greeting = greeting.replace(\"students\", \"Pythonistas\")\n",
    "\n",

    "A Quick Note on Strings\n",
    "In Python, strings are immutable. This means that simply running greeting.replace(\"students\", \"Pythonistas\") won't change the original variable by itself. You have to re-assign the result back to the variable greeting (or a new variable) to save the change.\n",
    "\n",
    "Would you like to see how to use the .replace() method to remove a word entirely by replacing it with an empty string?\n",
    "\n",
    "8.In the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "agreement = \"Paris Agreement\"\n",
    "\n",
    "agreement.replace(\"Paris\", \"Moon\")\n",
    "\n",
    "print(agreement)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The output is \"Paris Agreement\", not \"Moon Agreement\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Please explain why that is the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "This happens because strings in Python are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed once they are created.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run agreement.replace(\"Paris\", \"Moon\"), Python doesn't actually modify the original string stored in agreement. Instead, it creates a brand new string in the computer's memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "In your code, that new string (\"Moon Agreement\") is created, but it isn't saved anywhere, so it simply disappears. Meanwhile, the variable agreement is still pointing to the original, unchanged \"Paris Agreement\".\n",
    "\n",
    "How to fix it\n",
    "To see the change, you must re-assign the result back to the variable (or a new one), like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python\n",
    "agreement = \"Paris Agreement\" \n",
    "# Re-assign the variable to the new string created by .replace()\n",
    "agreement = agreement.replace(\"Paris\", \"Moon\") \n",
    "\n",
    "print(agreement)\n",
    "# Output: Moon Agreement\n",
    "Key Takeaway\n",
    "Any time you use a string method like .replace(), .upper(), or .strip(), remember that the original variable remains untouched unless you use the = operator to \"save\" the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Would you like to see how to check if two strings are the same object in memory using the id() function?\n",

    "10. Please explain why the statement returns \"False\" and write code that fixes the error:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ".3 + .3 + .3 == .9\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason this statement returns False is due to floating-point precision errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Explanation\n",
    "Computers represent numbers using binary (0s and 1s). While a number like 0.3 looks simple in base-10, it is a repeating fraction in binary—much like how 1/3 becomes 0.3333... in our decimal system.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you add 0.3 + 0.3 + 0.3, the tiny rounding errors in the binary representation accumulate. In Python, the result is actually: 0.8999999999999999\n",
    "\n",
    "Because 0.8999999999999999 is not exactly 0.9, the equality check (==) fails.\n",
    "\n",
    "How to Fix the Error\n",
    "There are three common ways to fix this depending on your goal:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use math.isclose() (Best Practice)\n",
    "The math.isclose() function checks if two numbers are \"close enough\" to be considered equal, accounting for these tiny errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python\n",
    "import math\n",
    "\n",
    "result = 0.3 + 0.3 + 0.3\n",
    "print(math.isclose(result, 0.9))  # Output: True\n",
    "2. Use round()\n",
    "You can round the result to a specific number of decimal places before comparing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python\n",
    "result = 0.3 + 0.3 + 0.3\n",
    "print(round(result, 1) == 0.9)  # Output: True\n",
    "3. Use the decimal Module\n",
    "If you need perfect accuracy (e.g., for financial calculations), use the Decimal type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python\n",
    "from decimal import Decimal\n",
    "\n",
    "result = Decimal('0.3') + Decimal('0.3') + Decimal('0.3')\n",
    "print(result == Decimal('0.9'))  # Output: True\n",
    "Summary: Never use == to compare floating-point numbers directly! Always use a method that allows for a tiny margin of error.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. I want to make a tip calculator. Step one:\n",

    "\n",
    "To start your tip calculator, you can use the input() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "One important thing to remember: input() always treats the user's entry as text (a string). Since you'll eventually want to do math with the \"price,\" you should convert it to a float (a decimal number).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the code to do that:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python\n",
    "# Accept input and convert it to a float for calculations\n",
    "price = float(input(\"Please enter a price of the meal: \"))\n",

    "\n",
    "When you use the input() function, Python treats whatever the user types as a string (text), even if they type a number. You cannot perform mathematical operations like multiplication (*) or addition (+) between a string and a number.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Breakdown of the Error:\n",
    "tip = price * 0.22: Python sees this as trying to multiply text by a decimal. It doesn't know how to \"multiply\" a word, so it throws a TypeError.\n",
    "\n",

    "Just like converting to a list, this will take every individual character (including spaces and punctuation) and turn it into a separate item in the tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Converting every character\n",
    "Python\n",
    "university = \"Yale\"\n",
    "yale_tuple = tuple(university)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(yale_tuple)\n",
    "# Output: ('Y', 'a', 'l', 'e')\n",
    "Example: Converting words to a tuple\n",
    "If you want a tuple of words rather than characters, you should first use .split() to create a list, and then wrap that in tuple():\n",
    "\n",
    "Python\n",
    "sentence = \"I love Python\"\n",
    "# Split into words first, then convert to tuple\n",
    "words_tuple = tuple(sentence.split())\n",
    "\n",
    "print(words_tuple)\n",
    "# Output: ('I', 'love', 'Python')\n",
    "Why use a tuple instead of a list?\n",
    "The main difference is that tuples are immutable. Once you create that tuple, you cannot change, add, or remove items. This makes them slightly faster and \"safer\" for data that shouldn't be altered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Would you like to see how to \"unpack\" a tuple into individual variables?\n",
    "\n",
    "23. How do you convert a string to an int in python? Give an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "To convert a string to an integer, you use the built-in int() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is essential when you use the input() function, because Python always collects user input as text, even if they type a number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "Python\n",
    "age_string = \"25\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Convert the string to an integer\n",
    "age_int = int(age_string)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Now you can perform math with it\n",
    "print(age_int + 5)\n",
    "# Output: 30\n",
    "Important Rules\n",
    "Digits Only: The string must contain only whole numbers. If the string has a decimal point (like \"25.5\") or letters (like \"abc\"), Python will throw a ValueError.\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling Decimals: If you have a string with a decimal (like \"25.5\") and you want it as a whole number, you must convert it to a float first, then an int:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python\n",
    "price_string = \"25.99\"\n",
    "# price_int = int(price_string)  <-- This would crash!\n",
    "price_int = int(float(price_string)) \n",
    "\n",
    "print(price_int)\n",
    "# Output: 25 (it truncates the decimal)\n",
    "Would you like to see how to use a try-except block to prevent your program from crashing if a user types something that isn't a number?\n",
    "\n",
    "24. How do you convert a string to a float in python? Give an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "To convert a string to a float (a number with a decimal point), you use the built-in float() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the standard way to handle prices, measurements, or any numeric input that might include a fraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "Python\n",
    "price_string = \"19.95\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Convert the string to a float\n",
    "price_float = float(price_string)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Now you can use it for calculations\n",
    "discounted_price = price_float * 0.9\n",
    "print(discounted_price)\n",
    "# Output: 17.955\n",
    "Key Points to Remember\n",
    "Whole Numbers: If you pass a whole number string like \"20\" into float(), it will convert it to 20.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scientific Notation: The float() function can also handle scientific notation strings, such as \"1e3\", which it will convert to 1000.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Errors: Just like int(), if the string contains letters or special characters (other than a single decimal point), Python will raise a ValueError.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pro-Tip: Handling Currency Symbols\n",
    "If your string has a dollar sign (e.g., \"$19.95\"), float() will fail. You have to remove the symbol first:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python\n",
    "price_with_symbol = \"$19.95\"\n",
    "clean_price = float(price_with_symbol.replace(\"$\", \"\"))\n",
    "\n",
    "print(clean_price)\n",
    "# Output: 19.95\n",
    "Would you like to see how to format that float back into a string with exactly two decimal places and a dollar sign for a report?\n",
    "\n",
    "25. How do you capitalizes first letter of string? Give an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "To capitalize only the first letter of a string (and make all other letters lowercase), you use the .capitalize() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "Python\n",
    "phrase = \"yale UNIVERSITY\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Capitalize the first letter\n",
    "capitalized_phrase = phrase.capitalize()\n",
    "\n",
    "print(capitalized_phrase)\n",
    "# Output: Yale university\n",
    "Important Distinction: .capitalize() vs. .title()\n",
    "Python offers two different ways to handle capitalization depending on your goal:\n",
    "\n",
    ".capitalize(): Only the very first letter of the entire string is uppercase. Everything else becomes lowercase.\n",
    "\n",
    ".title(): The first letter of every word is uppercase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python\n",
    "name = \"albert einstein\"\n",
    "\n",
    "print(name.capitalize()) # Output: Albert einstein\n",
    "print(name.title())      # Output: Albert Einstein\n",
    "Would you like me to show you how to use .upper() if you need to make the entire string capitalized?\n",
    "\n",
    "26. How do you check in a string that all characters are digits? Give an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "To check if a string contains only digits, you use the .isdigit() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method returns True if every character in the string is a digit (0-9). If there are any letters, spaces, symbols, or even a decimal point, it will return False.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "Python\n",
    "user_id = \"12345\"\n",
    "serial_code = \"123-45\"\n",
    "\n",
    "print(user_id.isdigit())    # Output: True\n",
    "print(serial_code.isdigit()) # Output: False (because of the hyphen)\n",
    "Important Distinction\n",
    "There are actually three methods that seem similar, but they behave slightly differently:\n",
    "\n",
    ".isdigit(): Checks for basic digits. It also returns True for some special Unicode digits like superscripts (²).\n",
    "\n",
    ".isnumeric(): The broadest check. It returns True for digits, fractions (½), and roman numerals in other languages.\n",
    "\n",
    ".isdecimal(): The strictest check. It only returns True for the standard numbers 0-9.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: None of these will return True for a string with a decimal point (like \"10.5\"), because the . symbol is not a digit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Would you like to see how to check if a string is a valid decimal number (including the dot) using a custom function?\n",
    "\n",
    "27. How do you check in a string that all characters are alphanumeric? Give an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "To check if a string contains only letters and numbers, you use the .isalnum() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "The term \"alphanumeric\" means the string consists of alphabetic characters (A−Z) and/or numeric digits (0−9). If the string contains any spaces, punctuation, or special symbols (like @, #, or $), the method will return False.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "Python\n",
    "username = \"YaleStudent2026\"\n",
    "invalid_username = \"Yale Student 2026!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "print(username.isalnum())         # Output: True\n",
    "print(invalid_username.isalnum()) # Output: False (due to spaces and the !)\n",
    "Key Details\n",
    "Empty Strings: Calling .isalnum() on an empty string (\"\") returns False.\n",
    "\n",
    "Only Letters: If a string is all letters (\"Yale\"), it is still considered alphanumeric and returns True.\n",
    "\n",
    "Only Numbers: If a string is all numbers (\"1701\"), it is also considered alphanumeric and returns True.\n",
    "\n",
    "Would you like to see how to use this to \"sanitize\" a string by removing all characters that aren't alphanumeric?\n",
    "\n",
    "28. How do you check in a string that all characters are in lowercase? Give an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "To check if all the letters in a string are lowercase, you use the .islower() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method returns True if there is at least one cased character and all cased characters in the string are lowercase. It ignores numbers, spaces, and symbols.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "Python\n",
    "phrase_one = \"hello world\"\n",
    "phrase_two = \"Hello World\"\n",
    "phrase_three = \"hello 2026!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "print(phrase_one.islower())   # Output: True\n",
    "print(phrase_two.islower())   # Output: False (because of 'H' and 'W')\n",
    "print(phrase_three.islower()) # Output: True (numbers/symbols are ignored)\n",
    "Important Nuance:\n",
    "The \"One Letter\" Rule: If a string contains no letters at all (for example, \"12345\" or \"!@#$\"), .islower() will return False.\n",
    "\n",
    "Casing only: It strictly looks for the absence of uppercase letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Would you like to see how to use .isupper() to check if a string is in all caps instead?\n",
    "\n",
    "29. How do you check in a string that all characters are not numbers. Give an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "To check if a string contains no numbers at all, the most common approach is to use the .isalpha() method if you only want letters, or a for loop if you want to allow symbols and spaces but specifically exclude digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Using .isalpha() (Strict: Letters Only)\n",
    "If you want to ensure the string contains only letters (no numbers, no spaces, no punctuation):\n",
    "\n",
    "Python\n",
    "name = \"Yale\"\n",
    "username = \"Yale2026\"\n",
    "\n",
    "print(name.isalpha())      # Output: True\n",
    "print(username.isalpha())  # Output: False\n",
    "2. Using any() and .isdigit() (Flexible: Any characters except numbers)\n",
    "If you want to allow spaces and symbols (like \"Hello!\") but specifically check that no digits (0−9) are present anywhere in the string, you can use this logical check:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python\n",
    "def has_no_numbers(input_string):\n",
    "    # Returns True if NONE of the characters are digits\n",
    "    return not any(char.isdigit() for char in input_string)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(has_no_numbers(\"Hello World!\")) # Output: True\n",
    "print(has_no_numbers(\"Hello 2026\"))   # Output: False\n",
    "Summary of Differences\n",
    ".isalpha(): Returns True only if everything is a letter.\n",

    "\n",
    "30. How do you get the length of the string? Give an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the length of a string, you use the built-in len() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "This function counts the total number of characters in the string, including letters, numbers, symbols, and spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "Python\n",
    "quote = \"Yale University\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Get the length\n",
    "length = len(quote)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(length)\n",
    "# Output: 15\n",
    "Important Details\n",
    "Spaces count: In the example above, the space between \"Yale\" and \"University\" counts as 1 character.\n",
    "\n",
    "Empty Strings: The length of an empty string (\"\") is 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Everything counts: Punctuation like exclamation points (!) or commas (,) also add to the length.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is this useful?\n",

    "\n",
    "31. How do you convert a string to all lowercase? Give an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this is a common task, Python makes it very simple with the .lower() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method takes every uppercase letter in your string and converts it to its lowercase equivalent. Any characters that aren't letters (like numbers or punctuation) remain exactly as they are.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "Python\n",
    "text = \"WELCOME to New Haven, CT 06520!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Convert the string to lowercase\n",
    "clean_text = text.lower()\n",
    "\n",
    "print(clean_text)\n",
    "# Output: welcome to new haven, ct 06520!\n",
    "Why use it?\n",

    "To remove all leading whitespace (the spaces, tabs, or newlines at the start of a string), you use the .lstrip() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"l\" in .lstrip() stands for left, which is the side where the string begins.\n",
